# Coursera_Capstone

This repository is dedicated to the capstone project for the Coursera/IBM data science professional certificate.

It contains Python code training a machine learning model to predict new locations for a farmer's market. 

This methodology could be used to locate other venue types so long as the venue’s existence has a relationship to the stores around it.

For a quick synopsis of what the code does, see the Farmer’sMarketLocator.pdf
